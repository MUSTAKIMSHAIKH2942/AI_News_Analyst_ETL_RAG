# 🧠 AI News Analyst — Real-Time ETL + RAG Pipeline (Python + FastAPI + LangChain + FAISS)

![AI ML Project Banner]()

> **A production-ready AI project that extracts, indexes, and answers questions about live news using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project is an end-to-end **ETL + RAG pipeline** for real-time news articles using cutting-edge technologies in AI and data engineering:

- **ETL Pipeline** — Extracts and processes news data from live RSS feeds (BBC, NYTimes)
- **FAISS Index** — Creates semantic search index using OpenAI Embeddings
- **LangChain RAG** — Combines FAISS with GPT for contextual question-answering
- **FastAPI Backend** — Exposes a real-time `/ask?q=your-question` API endpoint

## 🧪 How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Extract and Save News Data**

   ```bash
   python etl/news_etl.py
   ```

3. **Build Vector Store (FAISS)**

   ```python
   from rag.rag_engine import RAGPipeline
   rag = RAGPipeline()
   rag.build_vector_store()
   ```

4. **Start FastAPI Server**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. **Query the API**

   ```
   http://localhost:8000/ask?q=What happened in Ukraine?
   ```

## 🔍 Sample Output

```json
{
  "question": "What is the latest news on climate change?",
  "answer": "According to recent BBC reports, global temperatures continue to rise due to greenhouse emissions..."
}
```
